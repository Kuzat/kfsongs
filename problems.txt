* Need to get the mp3 version or a version as a buffer so I can create a md5 hash and add to data file. 

- Maybe we could just take a md5 hash of the youtube url or something? 
- That would work for same youtube videos, but what if there was another video with the same audio file or that someone downloaded the youtube video and uploaded it themself.
- That is a problem yes. But that would only lead to a max of 2 of same song since two youtube video surley dont have exactly the same audio file. With the scope of this project I think this would be the most logic fix.

* The folder are created before we download and check the audio file/youtube video. 
- Just create the file afterwards.
- That should fix it.

* We need a web input that can take the url
- Should be easy.
